## My story

Hi, call me Jack. I have been coding ever since I got my first 386 with QBasic. I have always loved computer games, and the making of them. But back then there was really no big industry for game developers. Only if you were lucky enough to be hired by a big studio. So I worked as a regular programmer for many years, and then fell sick for many years, not even wanting to look at a computer. 

Meanwhile the market changed. Now there are awesome programming suites like [Godot](https://godotengine.org) and marketplaces like [Itch.io](https://itch.io) that makes it easier than ever to realize your vision to bring joy to others. And watching amazing people like [Thor at Pirate Software](https://www.gopiratesoftware.com) helped reignite my childhood passion.

My aim is to make games that are enjoyable and uplifting. Educational without being boring. Inclusive of people with disabilities. And not littered with ads or devious scemes to make you lose money, like those fake games in the ads.
